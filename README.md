## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This Docker image provides a comprehensive, lightweight, and secure solution
for running Atlantis with additional infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools.

It combines Atlantis, OpenTofu, Terragrunt, and Terragrunt Atlantis Config into
a single, streamlined container, making infrastructure management and
automation seamless.

- **Architecture Support**:

  - Compatible with `arm64` and `amd64` architectures
  - Dynamically detects and configures based on system architecture

- **Security-Focused**:

  - Uses distroless base image for minimal attack surface
  - Implements SHA256 checksum verification for all downloaded binaries
  - Runs with non-root permissions

- **Version Flexibility**:
  - Configurable versions for each tool via build arguments
  - Easy to upgrade or pin to specific versions
